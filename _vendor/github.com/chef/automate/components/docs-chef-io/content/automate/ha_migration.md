## What is Migration?

A migration is the transfer of data, information, or technology from one place, or system, to another. It's common for teams to migrate their infrastructure components to improve scalability and performance, improve the caching layer, or transition from an in-house solution to a cloud-based one.

A few common examples of IT migration include:

- Upgrading an application or operating system (OS).
- Moving data from one kind of database to another.
- Replacing one data storage system with another.
- Moving from on-premise infrastructure to cloud infrastructure.
